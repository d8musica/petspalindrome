# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

.env files where used for the API at 'https://crudcrud.com/api/${process.env.REACT_APP_CRUD_API}/'

I'm going to send it through email.

simple dockerfile for the app is performed

Use:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `CONSUMO DE APIS`

In this section of the application I'm implementing CRUD API service for PETS.
Use those functionalities to create a pet, update it, and delete it.
Use Show pets whenever you want to check those pets that were created before

### `ALGORITMO`

In this section I took the given string and perform a function which allows to get those palindromic words in the string composed by more than 3 characters.

given string:
